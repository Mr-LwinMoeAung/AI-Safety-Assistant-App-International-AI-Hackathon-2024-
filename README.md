# International Ai Hackathon 2024
# AI Assistant Safety App
## Description
AI-Powered Safety Assistant is an advanced application designed to enhance occupational safety and reduce workplace accidents. Developed during a hackathon in Thailand, this project leverages state-of-the-art AI technologies to create a robust safety assistant that can proactively identify and mitigate potential hazards in various work environments.

Key Features:
- AI-Driven Object Detection: Utilized OpenCV and YOLO to implement real-time object detection, ensuring prompt identification of potential safety risks in the workplace.
- Generative AI Integration: Integrated cutting-edge AI models like Claude 3 Sonnet and Amazon Titan-Embed-Text to deliver generative capabilities, enhancing the system's ability to analyze and respond to various safety scenarios.
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Implemented RAG to streamline document retrieval and language generation processes, enabling accurate, context-aware responses that improve decision-making and safety assessments.
This AI-powered safety assistant serves as a valuable tool for enhancing workplace safety by combining real-time detection, advanced AI-driven analysis, and responsive communication, ultimately reducing the risk of accidents and improving overall safety protocols.
